# Weather Project

This weather app was a project for an advanced JavaScript coding workshop. I became skilled in Bootstrap, APIs, real-life development workflow using Git and GitHub, hosting on Netlify, and advanced JavaScript. I combined all of these skills to build a Vanilla JavaScript Weather App, which uses the API from OpenWeatherMap to extract weather data.
